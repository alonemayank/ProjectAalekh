## OBJECTIVE

Article search system provides user with options to search for articles based on their content, author and title. The application will provide related articles that match the input string provided. To perform the search, first we will find an efficient classification algorithm to do the indexing and later after processing and comparison of input within dataset, results will be displayed. The output will have the exact matched results and the most closed matched articles in descending order. Also, based on search string, we would propose user with few other articles that he might be interested in reading. This recommendation will be based on popularity of search string.

## INTRODUCTION

  Nowadays, everything is available on Google. But, the results that we get are scattered and lot of unrelated results are observed. Also, more number of clicks and time is required to find accurate and related articles. This is frustrating for readers. But, the system that we are building would be useful to serve the purpose of quick search of articles. Readers, who are looking for articles on particular topic or multiple articles on particular topic would benefit from this system as all the information will be provided at one stop and in the manner as they want. Another useful thing is the recommendation system. It will recommend related articles which might prove beneficial to the reader.

  Wikipedia is one of the best web resource that provides article search option. It has very huge collection of articles related to diversified categories. The difference between Wikipedia and our system is that Wikipedia focuses very little on its search as it focuses on its content and our system will not only focus on the search but also recommend other related articles that reader might be interested in reading. We think readers will benefit from this as if someone searches for quantum mechanics would like to read about classic physics or early quantum theory. Recommendations provided by our system will give them more similar choices which would help them in whatever they are looking for and their work will be easier and faster. It is going to be a little complex to build such a system as we need to decide the basis for recommending the articles and also will have to figure out the way to implement it.

  We are planning to use Wikipedia articles dataset. Wikipedia dataset is available under open knowledge on DBpedia provided by Wikipedia itself under the same license terms as Wikipedia. These articles consist of different categories that will help us building our index for better searching. We will implement appropriate algorithm that would help users to get results in no time and it would be efficient even in heavy traffic load times. Our recommendation system will incorporate more than one approach to make recommendation more useful. Building this application would require research and analysis to best fit appropriate algorithm.

  We will develop this application using web technologies that will include client and server side scripting languages and stylesheet. We will deploy this application system on a web server with responsive design to make it available not just for computers but also for smartphones and tablets. We will be more certain about the combination of algorithm and technologies as we proceed depending on the efficiency and complexity of implementation.
